CAUTION:

The purpose of the regression tests found in this directory are to verify specific features of the EMOD disease transmission kernel.
Many of these tests, due to abnormally high or low values, will produce output that should not be considered scientifically accurate.
These tests are provided to our development community as a tool to determine that any changes to the source code did not disrupt functionality of eradication.exe.
