(We've removed the multi-node climate simulation using the vector model.
Extensive multi-node simulations with location-specific climate, intervention
deployments, larval habitat, and migration may be configured within the EMOD
framework.  For information on configuring and running large, multi-node
simulations, please contact IDMSupport@idmod.org.)
