Specification:
--------------
Starting on Jan 1, 2020, men get tested at a rate of 10% per year (on a continual basis over time). Those testing positive are referred to an HIV clinic for staging if not already in care. Of these, 25% immediately appear for staging and 75% resuming their pre-test behavior. Those testing negative immediately get circumcised with 80% probability.


Implementation Notes:
---------------------
On Jan 1, 2020, all individuals are pushed into an extended HCT testing loop by broadcasting "HCTTestingLoop2".  In parallel, starting Jan 1, 2020, all new born males broadcast "HCTTestingLoop2".  In order to capture 10% of men per year, all individuals that drop out of the cascade are similarly pushed into the extended HCT loop.  A BroadcastEvent diagnostic targeted to males only is distributed in 2020, that is triggered by "HCTTestingLoop2", "HCTUptakePostDebut9", and"HCTUptakePostDebut3", and broadcasts "HCTTestingLoop3".  This configuration insures that only males after 2020 broadcast "HCTUptakePostDebut3".  The selected males then receive a muxed exponential delay with a mean of 10 years.  Following the delay, these individuals are given a HIVRapidHIVDiagnostic.  HIV positive individuals are given a random choice either 1) draw another delay from an exponential distribution to test again (75% probability), or 2) go directly to ART staging with no additional loss (25% probability).  Those who test HIV negative are given an 80% chance for immediate male circumcision, and do not draw a new delay to testing.  No existing testing modalities are interrupted by the extended HCT testing loop, so individuals that were otherwise selected for standard HCT (exponential delay, mean=1 year, and repeated until HIV positive) will continue to test this way in parallel with the extended HCT testing loop.
