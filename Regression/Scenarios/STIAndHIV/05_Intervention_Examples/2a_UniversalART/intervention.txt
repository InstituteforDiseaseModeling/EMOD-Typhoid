Specification:
--------------
Assume that linkage and retention rates for those initiating at CD4>500 are equal to those initiating at CD4 350-500


Implementation Notes:
---------------------
Parameter changes only.

There are two places where ARTStagingCD4AgnosticDiagnostic's occur: ARTStaging (state 4), and OnPreART (state 2).  In both of these places, the WHO threshold for adults and children are changed to allow universal eligibility after 2020.

Just to be safe, the corresponding ARTStagingCD4Diagnostic's in ARTStaging (state 6) and OnPreART (state 4) are also set to allow universal eligibility (CD4<1000) after 2020.
