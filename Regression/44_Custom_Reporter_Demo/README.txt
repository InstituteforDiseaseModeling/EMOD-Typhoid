44_Custom_Reporter_Demo

To completely test this scenario, one needs to build the BasicReportPlugin.sln.  
This will create the following DLLs:
   x64/Release/reporter_plugins/libreporteventcounter.dll
   x64/Release/reporter_plugins/libreportpluginbasic.dll

Then use a regression_test.py command line similar to:

python regression_test.py --all-outputs --use-dlls vector.json ..\Eradication\x64\Release\Eradication.exe

--use-dlls will copy the dlls that were created to the cluster
--all-outputs will compare all of the files in the "output" directory including the ones generated by the DLLs
