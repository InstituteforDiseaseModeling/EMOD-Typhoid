Copied from 50 mOPV1 and tweaked from there.

Just changed the mOPV1 stuff to be about mOPV3

Added plotChangedCharts, which only shows you the charts that have changed from one output folder to the next.  This was added because the WPV3 charts weren't showing up in the plotAllCharts script, which cuts off at 36 channels.

NOTE: This script won't take a single chart any more.
