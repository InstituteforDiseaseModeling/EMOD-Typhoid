The set of tests under this directory is meant for testing serialization for multicore execution of scenarios that involve multinode demographics with migration.
They are based off of existing regression scenarios in the parent Regression folder. The scenarios are modified to use a set of LD generated demographics/climate files for the Madagascar Nosibe region. Migration is enabled and uses migration files generated by internal tools.
